# * Create a file called `item.py` and add an `Item` class in there.

#   * The item should have `name` and `description` attributes.

#      * Hint: the name should be one word for ease in parsing later.

#   * This will be the _base class_ for specialized item types to be declared
#     later.

# * Add the ability to add items to rooms.

#   * The `Room` class should be extended with a `list` that holds the `Item`s
#     that are currently in that room.

#   * Add functionality to the main loop that prints out all the items that are
#     visible to the player when they are in that room.

# * Add capability to add `Item`s to the player's inventory. The inventory can
#   also be a `list` of items "in" the player, similar to how `Item`s can be in a
#   `Room`.
